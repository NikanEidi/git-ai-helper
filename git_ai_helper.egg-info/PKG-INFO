# 🤖 Git AI Helper

A smart, interactive Git command-line assistant with autocomplete, AI-powered suggestions, and helpful guidance — designed to make Git easy, even for beginners!

---

### 🧠 How the AI works

Git AI Helper includes an intelligent suggestion engine that analyzes user input and provides corrections or alternatives for mistyped Git commands.

For example:
- Input: `git cmomit`
- Suggestion: `git commit` — Record changes with a message

The AI logic is implemented via `ai_suggester.py`, which uses semantic matching and command similarity detection to make accurate recommendations.

*Note: This is a lightweight AI logic designed for CLI use — not a large language model like ChatGPT.*
